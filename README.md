The work deals with a particular aspect of the use of IoT - the design and implementation of a monitoring system.
More specifically, it is the design and implementation of an IoT attendance system using biometric methods to record the arrivals and departures of employees.
We have presented in detail the system architecture and the implementation process of the camera and fingerprint sensor management software.
These steps led to the creation of a comprehensive attendance system that allows easy employee login using biometric data.
In addition, we also worked on monitoring movement in the designated area and implementing services for archiving photos and sending alerts when security breaches occur.
The results of this work can contribute to the development and use of IoT, where the simple and efficient use of the application by employees is ensured and the risk of errors in the attendance tracking process is minimized.
Monitoring movement in designated areas can contribute to increasing efficiency and safety in the work environment.
